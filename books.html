                   <p>On her thirteenth birthday, Anne Frank’s parents give her a diary. She’s excited because she wants someone—or something—in which to confide all of her secret thoughts. Even though she has a rich social life, she feels misunderstood by everyone she knows. Anne starts writing about daily events, her thoughts, school grades, boys, all that.
 But, within a month, her entire life changes.

                   <p>The place: Maycomb, Alabama, finalist for Most Boring Town in America. Few people move in, fewer move out, so it's just the same families doing the same things for generation after generation. Like the Finches: Scout, her brother Jem, and their father Atticus. Every summer Scout and Jem are joined by Dill Harris, who shares their obsession with the local haunted house, the Radley Place, and the boogeyman who lives there, Boo Radley.
 Fall comes, Dill leaves, and Scout starts school. The Radley Place is in between Scout's house and school, so she has to go by it every day, usually at top speed. One day she notices something odd: a couple of pieces of gum stuck in a hole in the tree. She tells Jem about it, and soon they find other treasures hidden in the same place, including finely-carved soap figurines of Scout and Jem themselves. This lasts until the following fall, when they find that Mr. Nathan (Boo's brother) has filled in the knothole with cement.

                   <p>This novel is a Bildungsroman (a coming-of-age story) written in the first person by the fictional Jane Eyre. It is also a “gothic” novel (set in a dark, exotic locale with mystery and romance mixed in equal portions). Jane is a strong-willed, ten-year-old orphan (her parents died of typhus) who lives with her uncle’s family. Other than the nursemaid, the family ostracizes Jane and treats her horribly; her cousin John constantly bullies her. She is then sent off to the austere Lowood Institution, a charity school, where she and the other girls are also horribly treated; “Lowood,” as the name makes plain, is the “low” point in Jane’s young life. But in the face of her mistreatment and constant adversity, Jane gathers strength and confidence. In early adulthood, after several years as a student and then teacher at Lowood, she then musters the courage to leave. She finds work as a governess at Thornfield Hall, where she meets her dashing and Byronic employer, the wealthy but impetuous Edward Rochester.

                   <p>ur intrepid narrator, a former schoolteacher famously "called" Ishmael—is that actually his name?— signs up as sailor on a whaling voyage to cure a bout of depression/being a misanthropic dirtbag. On his way to find a ship in Nantucket, he meets Queequeg, a heavily tattooed South Sea Island harpooneer just returned from his latest whaling trip. Ishmael and Queequeg become best buds and roommates almost immediately. Together, they sign up for a voyage on the Pequod, which is just about to start on a three-year expedition to hunt sperm whales.

On board the Pequod, Ishmael meets the mates—honest Starbuck, jolly Stubb, and fierce Flask—and the other harpooneers, Tashtego and Daggoo. The ship’s commander, Captain Ahab, remains secluded in his cabin and never shows himself to the crew. Uh, that's ominous. Oh well. The mates organize the beginning of the voyage as though there were no captain.
